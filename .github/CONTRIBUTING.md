# How to contribute to C# Code Snippets

Currently this repository is only for C# snippets for Visual Studio. They can be for any framework though, for example we have ASP.NET MVC C# snippets.

## New Snippets - Requests

If you want to just request a new Snippet then please just log an [Issue](https://github.com/garfbradaz/csharp-codesnippets/issues/new), detailing:

- Requested snippet short code - example we have `mvcselect` snippet. 
- Behaviour of the snippet.
- Label the issue as ![**new snippet please**] (../.github/label-new-snippet-please.PNG).

## Bugs with existing stable Snippets

Now contray to what my wife says, I'm not perfect, so if you find a *bug* then please report it:

- Log an [Issue](https://github.com/garfbradaz/csharp-codesnippets/issues/new).
- Complete the suggested details and more if you have it.
